        p There are multiple layers to our research that focuses on blood shortage, social media, recruitment, and data analysis techniques. Blood shortage is a global issue that continues to be a key challenge. Social media is a powerful approach to understanding and analyzing both donors'/non-donors' attitudes and awareness toward blood donation. Social media and survey data analysis will identify donation and engagement trends. Blood donation organizations will benefit from this research since they play a fundamental role in organizing and promoting blood donation opportunities.<br><br>Our research seeks to learn how young people find out about blood donation opportunities, what drives them to participate, and the blood donation community. We will compare blood donation-related content on social media, Twitter and Instagram, and a survey distributed across two geographic locations, Milan and New York City. Findings from our research will contribute to providing engagement strategies to attract and inform young donors in understanding their essential role in blood donation.
