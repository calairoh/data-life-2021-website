            h1 Why do young people have poor knowledge about blood donation?
            h3 Barriers to blood donation 

            p.intro-text Reasons for young people having insufficient knowledge about blood donation include lifestyle, donation location, and time limitations. An additional reason could be that young people lack a personal connection to the cause or are not motivated to donate blood unless encouraged by their surroundings due to the lack of awareness and misinformation. Ultimately, young people may not be aware of opportunities due to their lack of interaction with organizations or individuals involved in this process.

            p There are 3 main reasons why people don’t donate:
            ul
                li The first one is related to the blood donation activity itself. For example, people may not donate due to fear of needles or feeling unwell during or after the donation
                li The second one is related to logistics, primarily difficulty in organizing a place and time to donate
                li Lastly, there is a miscellaneous group that consists of several reasons, the most common being medical-related.  Some reasons include: a person weighs less than 50kg (quite common, especially for women), “strange” reasons, like non-sterile needles, and fake news-based concerns

            p Survey results showed a similar breakdown of the reasons why people do not donate blood in both regions. Furthermore, the results distinguish various misinformation such as reuse of needles, safety measures being ignored, blood donation causes weakness and decrease in athletic performance, and inability to donate blood permanently if you have tattoos or piercings.

                p We also asked survey respondents where they first got information about donating blood to understand existing information regarding blood donation opportunities. Comparing our target group to prior volunteers, for both groups, friends and/or relatives are the most common source of information for Italy, and school or employer is the most common source of information for the US.

            div.appendix-body
                p Even though social media was not the main source for first receiving blood donation information, we performed a comment analysis to see how social media users interact with the most engaging posts on these platforms. The most engaging post on Twitter showed that one out of four replies support blood donations and request more information. Analyzing the top 20 most engaging posts on Instagram showed positive support and negative feedback for the cause, and there were questions and misinformation present in the comments.
