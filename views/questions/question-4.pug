            h1 How does the blood community share interest for other social-ethical topics?
            h3 Blood donors and other health and social-ethical interests 
        
            p.intro-text There are differences between blood donors and non-blood donors in converting their opinions into positive blood donation behaviors. Altruism and empathy are the main factors underlying blood donation. However, blood donation behavior is complicated, and we want to analyze the differences in social representations of blood donation between donors and non-donors. Our goal is to identify the relationship between the blood donating community and its relation to other communities. Furthermore, we want to research if young people active in blood donation-related social media platforms are involved in other social-ethical groups online. Finally, we will evaluate if it is necessary to combine the blood community with other social-ethical topics online to attract potential blood donors.

Therefore, posts related to social-ethical topics are helpful content to target potential donors and could also increase the relations between altruistic topics.
