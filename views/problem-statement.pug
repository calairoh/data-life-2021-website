            p Blood shortage is a global issue that continues to be a key challenge; recruiting new donors is critical in sustaining a sufficient blood supply.  Almost 60% of donors are older than 40, and nearly 45% are older than 50<sup><a target=”_blank” href="https://www.aabb.org/news-resources/news/article/2021/01/14/aabb-news-the-evolution-of-donor-recruitment-strategies">1</a></sup>. As shown below, there is a dip in donors between the ages of 18-30<sup><a target=”_blank” href="https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-and-social-sector/our-insights/improving-the-fragile-us-supply-of-blood ">2</a></sup>. Therefore, young people are vital in donation recruitment as they could be potential donors for a long time. This study defines young people as 20-30 years old and is the age group of interest to learn about behavior toward blood donations on social media.

            p Unless encouraged by their surroundings, young people are not motivated to donate blood. Therefore, we want to understand how young people find out about blood donation opportunities, what drives them to participate and the role social media plays in recruitment. <b>What are the successful engagement strategies to recruit young blood donors using social media?</b><br><br>Social media and survey analysis will compare two cities, NYC and Milan, to identify successful engagement strategies in both locations. The research questions below, informed by our literature review and interviews with industry experts, will guide our analysis.
