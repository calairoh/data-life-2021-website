            p Our findings provide valuable insights for how to use social media as a strategy to recruit new donors and encourage existing donors to continue donating. 

            h5 Where to post?

            p Analysis of emergencies as a tactic to recruit donors on social media showed posts that include terms like ‘Blood Shortage’ and during times of emergencies, such as COVID-19, generate more engagement and posts. Therefore, these times may be ideal for posts related to blood donation since the public may be more likely to be motivated to donate blood during this time. Posting on important days related to the topic, such as National Blood day, could also create more interest in this conversation on social media, resulting in more donations.

            h5 Who (organizations/individuals) should post and why?

            p The behavior of blood donation organizations on social media showed that engagement is related to the magnitude of their following on a particular platform. Survey results also indicated less than 20 percent of respondents follow the blood donation organizations in their area. Therefore, targeted efforts to increase the number of blood donation organization followers on social media platforms could increase the visibility of these institutions and generate more engagement which in turn, may result in recruiting more donors.<br><br>Assessing survey results related to the barriers of blood donation revealed that young people may not be aware of opportunities due to their limited interaction with blood donation organizations or active donors. Blood donation organizations can ask donors to share their experience on social media to promote the cause amongst their network so that more young people become aware of opportunities through individuals and institutions they trust.<br><br>Social media influencers could be leveraged as ambassadors to remind and encourage more young people to donate blood, see the influencer tool below for more information on how to designate a ‘good’ candidate for a blood donation influencer. Analysis of the most engaging posts on Instagram and survey results show that individual accounts may be best suited to promote blood donation in Italy whereas individual accounts are better for the United States. In both locations, political accounts should be avoided as influencers since they tend to spread negative information and shift the conversation away from blood donation.

            h5 What to post?

            p Qualitative analysis of active members in the blood donation conversation online and analysis of survey results showed a relationship between donors and social-ethical causes. Therefore, posts related to social-ethical topics could be helpful content to target potential donors.

            p We developed four personas to represent a potential donor and donor in both locations based on our survey results and interviews with individuals. While there isn’t much difference between the potential donors and typical donors, these personas could be helpful to those interested in learning more about the young people’s social media use and feeling towards blood donation in efforts to create social media engagement strategies.
